                    <p>This artifact showcases my participation in the AI Bootcamp – Free Hands-On Azure AI Lab, a 
                        hands-on workshop held during the March Tech Alley Vegas event. In this lab, I used Microsoft Azure’s 
                        cloud platform to deploy and test AI models, leveraging services like Azure Machine Learning Studio 
                        and Cognitive Services. The simulation focused on real-time object detection using pre-trained models, 
                        and I experimented with tweaking parameters and deploying the model as an API endpoint. 
                        The most challenging part was optimizing the model within the limited Azure credits and troubleshooting 
                        API deployment errors, which required an understanding of resource management and cloud permissions. What 
                        made this experience unique was how accessible high-level AI tools became when paired with real-time collaboration 
                        and live support from industry mentors. This project reinforced core computer science concepts such as abstraction, 
                        modularity, and algorithmic thinking. It also deepened my appreciation for cloud-based development and showed how 
                        powerful scalable computing can be when paired with machine learning frameworks.</p>

                    <p>This artifact reflects my participation in the Cloudflare x Codingscape AI Hacknight,
                         a collaborative event held during the HumanX conference in Las Vegas. During this event, 
                         I teamed up with fellow attendees to prototype an AI-powered web tool using Cloudflare’s 
                         free developer tools and generative AI models. We built a simple content generation assistant 
                         that integrated Cloudflare Workers and leveraged OpenAI's API to provide real-time suggestions 
                         for blog writers. The evening emphasized rapid development and creativity under time constraints, 
                         with a demo session showcasing everyone's work. A major challenge was learning to deploy serverless 
                         functions on the fly while debugging unfamiliar APIs, which deepened my understanding of edge 
                         computing and asynchronous programming. What made the experience memorable was the supportive,
                          beginner-friendly atmosphere that welcomed developers of all levels. This project reinforced the 
                          importance of iteration, testing, and collaboration in the software development process—core
                           pillars of computational thinking.

                    <p>This artifact showcases my team’s submission for the Individual Learning Plan 
                        (ILP) Student Portal, a web development project created for the Tech Ready Rebels 
                        program at UNLV. Built using a free WordPress platform, the site serves as a centralized 
                        tool for students to document program activities, track learning progress, and reflect
                         on career outcomes. Our team focused on building a responsive, user-friendly interface 
                         that adhered to UNLV’s brand guidelines while meeting competition requirements for
                          functionality and design. One of the most rewarding parts of this experience was
                           collaborating with fellow aspiring engineers—many nights were spent not only working 
                           on the project but also talking about our other ideas, learning from one another, 
                           and building real friendships. I gained a tremendous amount of hands-on experience 
                           in website development and design thinking, especially while working alongside a 
                           senior developer to plan backend database integration. This project strengthened 
                           my skills in teamwork, creative problem-solving, and user-centered design. I’m 
                           proud of the final product, but even more grateful for the team experience, and 
                           I can’t wait to continue working in collaborative environments to design and 
                           create in the future.</p>
